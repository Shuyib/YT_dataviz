# Plans
# make a Line and area plot like above
# I'll need textinput for the user to enter the column that they are interested in and update
# the title as the column updates
# the labs column will also require a textinput to relabel the y-axis
# A code book tab to show the user what the variables mean 
# subsetted plot to compare users that are independent of each other
# a line of best fit as well include it 
# A side bar with the names of the channels, can they be reactive
# use this to make the application
